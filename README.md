# TON Smart Contract Development with Tolk

These tutorials take you on a journey into the depths of smart contract development for TON using the Tolk language, covering everything from the basics to advanced concepts and critical details. Each guide follows a step-by-step approach, with extensively commented code in key areas to provide context and clarity.

Tolk is a smart contract development language for The Open Network (TON) blockchain, featuring a modern Kotlin-like syntax. Its compiler is a fork of the FunC compiler, meaning you get the same bytecode with a much friendlier syntax and fewer opportunities for errors. See more on the differences and improvements [here](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-detail).

Welcome aboard! 🏴‍☠️

## Tutorials

### 👶 1. Basics and Testing

#### 1.1. [Create and Deploy, Part 1: Implementing Logic](1-1-create-and-deploy-1/README.md)

Create a smart contract using Blueprint. Get acquainted with Tolk syntax and implement basic logic.

#### 1.2. [Create and Deploy, Part 2: Deployment, Wrappers, Message Basics](1-2-create-and-deploy-2/README.md)

Deploy the smart contract to testnet. Gain a basic understanding of wrappers, internal and external messages, and get methods.

#### 1.3. [Automated Testing](1-3-tests/README.md)

Automate smart contract testing using Sandbox. Understand the test environment and test cases.

#### 1.4. [Conditional Logic, Part 1: Opcodes, Exceptions, and TDD](1-4-opcodes-and-tdd-1/README.md)

Implement conditional logic using operation codes. Learn about exceptions and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

#### 1.5. [Conditional Logic, Part 2: Handling Valid Opcodes](1-5-opcodes-and-tdd-2/README.md)

Apply TDD to implement and validate conditional logic while handling edge cases.

#### 1.6. Fees

🚧 **Coming soon!** 🚧 A deep dive into fees on TON, along with tips and practical methods for estimating contract gas efficiency. 

### 👦 2. Communication

#### 2.1. [Addresses, Part 1: Raw Addresses and States](2-1-addresses-and-states-1/README.md)

To send a message, you need to know the address. Gain an in-depth understanding of raw addresses and account states on the TON Blockchain.

#### 2.2. [Addresses, Part 2: User-Friendly Addresses](2-2-addresses-and-states-2/README.md)

Learn about user-friendly addresses. Start writing a wallet app to test their different flavors.

#### 2.3. [Addresses, Part 3: Flags](2-3-addresses-and-states-3/README.md)

Implement checks for network type and bounceability flags in user-friendly addresses. Gain a practical understanding of how bounceability affects transactions.

#### 2.4. Internal Messages

🚧 **Coming soon!** 🚧 Everything you need to know about modes, flags, and more!
